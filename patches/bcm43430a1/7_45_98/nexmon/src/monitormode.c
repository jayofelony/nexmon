 * That ROM function's only exit is the tail call to wl_monitor at 0x81F620, so
 * flashpatching 0x81F620 (as FW_VER_ALL does, and as works fine on 7.45.41.46,
 * whose stock table has no such diversion) patches code that never runs: the
 * hook is silently dead and monitor mode captures nothing.
 *
 * The RAM reimplementation at 0xd4e4 mirrors the ROM function exactly and ends
 * in the same tail call, against a RAM copy of wl_monitor at 0xa5e2:
 *
 *   ROM 0x81f61a  ldr r0,[r5,#8] / mov r1,sp / mov r2,r6 / bl wl_monitor
 *   RAM 0x00d710  ldr r0,[r6,#8] / mov r1,sp / mov r2,r8 / bl 0xa5e2
 *
 * so the correct hook point for this firmware is the RAM call site at 0xd716.
 * This is an ordinary RAM patch, not a flashpatch.
